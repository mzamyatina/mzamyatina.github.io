I am a chemist with a background in meteorology. I study the climate of the Earth, Earth-like rocky planets and hot gas giants. I focus on the interactions between the gas-phase chemistry and atmospheric dynamics, and how these affect the observable properties of planetary atmospheres. For this I use a 3D chemistry-climate model, the Met Office Unified Model, and lead the work on improving the representation of chemical kinetics in its exoplanet configuration.
